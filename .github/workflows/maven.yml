# This workflow will build a Java project with Maven, and cache/restore any dependencies to improve the workflow execution time
# For more information see: https://help.github.com/actions/language-and-framework-guides/building-and-testing-java-with-maven
# We do not use maven-publish.yml as .m2/settings.xml is overridden in public repos. Instead, mvn deploy is
# called from local developer machine with user and key.
