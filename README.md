Adam's Personal GitHub Prototyping Repositories and Demo Showcase

The Cat Repositories are conceptually linked by the vision of a Charity dedicated to the care of Cats in need.

The Cats API repository specifically creates the interface agreements between components and the specifications that need to be implemented in order any new application technology to be showcased. This includes standard definitions of what the Cat Charity App must do including:
- RESTful APIs
- Database Entity Definitions
- Data Models
- Rules Capabilities
- Orchestration Capabilities
- A few util goodies
  I understand that not everything in this repository meets Martin Fowler or other industry expert's definition of design vs implementation, but this is my best way to compare and contrast technology frameworks as we look for the next latest and greatest frameworks, runes engines and workflow engines.
- Java
- Spring Boot
- RESTful Services
- Maven

I try to spend at least a few hours a week trying to keep up my technical skillset via prototyping.

I spend about 50% of my time doing Software & Professional Leadership activities</br>

TBH...</br>
I'd rather be coding!</br>
